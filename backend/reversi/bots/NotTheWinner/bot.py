        Called by the game to get a move based on the given game board

        Tip: The game expects the move to be valid. To check move validity, use is_valid_move(board, self.color, (row_index, column_index)).

        board: The game board as a row-column array of "black", "white", or "", i.e. the cell board[3][4] refers to row three and column 4. The rows and columns are indexed from 0 (valid values 0-7).

        Returns: The position to place the disc on as a tuple (row_index, column_index), i.e. (7, 2) for row 7 and column 2. Note that the position *has* to be valid (otherwise the game server will throw an error). Use the is_valid_move from reversi/logic to test whether a move is valid or not.
